## Filename interpretation

This directory contains wav files to be used in conjunction with the `test_dtmf_pipeline.py` test. Each wav file represents a sequence to be detected. The expected sequence characters are encoded in the filename and are according to the following table

|Character|Meaning|
|---------|-------|
|`0..9`|Numbers `0..9`|
|`A,B,C,D`|Characters `A,B,C,D`|
|`s`|Star `*` character|
|`p`|Hash or Pound `#` character|
|`P`|Long pause of 1sec, ignored in detection|
|`d`|Short pause of 100ms, ignored in detection|
|`--`|Marks end of detection symbolics. Everything thereafter is ignored in detection|

## Capture Methods

Pure DTMF tone sequences are generated through http://dialabc.com/sound/generate/

Radio overlayed signal (marked with `RadioOverlay` suffix) are generated by capturing real talk radio stations using a microphone at 8000Hz. Pure DTMF sequences are then mixed in at different time points (using AudaCity) using varying levels of volume.
